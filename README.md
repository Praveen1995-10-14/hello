# Getting started section

>The main goals of this project are:
 - How to create branches with different base branches.
 - To deal with version control.
 - Follow GitHub flow.
 - Open pull request.
 - Write descriptive to understand commit messages.
 - Write short, detailed and easy to understand descriptions of pull requests.
 - Demonstrate an ability to submit a project for code review.


  - I used vsCode as my code editor.

  - In my vsCode i made 3 files :

  - A .html file that includes a header with the text "Hello Microverse!".

  - A .css file that includes one class with styles for your header.

  - A test.md file with the text "This file should be ignored by git".

  - with the help of gitbash i initialised all my files ,open pull request and the make them commit on my github.
